# Dot Net Support
The purpose of this project is to provide an example of how access to methods and data outside the .Net world can be emulated within the .Net world. There is a companion project called **CppTranslatorSupport** that will implement the same classes and methods in the C# world. By doing this, features in the target environment can be emulated in .Net so that any algorithms to be translated can be fully tested within .Net.

See the README.md file in the **CppTranslatorSupport** for more details.
